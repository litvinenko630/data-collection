# data-collection
The folder to store the process of honing my data collection skills.

During this course I want to accomplish the following goals:
1.	Skill Development: The folder serves as a central repository for storing your projects, scripts, and resources focused on data collection. It allows to practice and experiment with different techniques, tools, and methods of gathering data from the internet.
2.	Documentation and Learning: By organizing the data collection process in this folder, I'll create a record of my journey and progress. This documentation can serve as a valuable resource for future reference and learning.
3.	Portfolio Building: The folder can also act as a portfolio showcasing my data collection skills. By keeping my projects organized and well-documented, I can demonstrate my abilities and expertise to potential employers, collaborators, or clients who may be interested in my data collection capabilities.
